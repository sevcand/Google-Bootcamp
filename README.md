## Sprint #1

* **Sprint Notes:** Story points and user stories have been explained product backlog entries. The details could be found in full entry mode.
*  **Possible Sprint Completion:** 70 Points
*  **Backlog Orgnization and Story Choices:** Product Backlog is organized to detail every feature that is predicted to be implemented to the product by the end of the 3rd Sprint. Stories were based on how the product could be made more appealing to the user with graphics, animation, asset quality and so on.
*  **Daily Scrum:** In this first sprint, Daily Scrums were conducted on 3 seperate channels(ClickUp Chat, Whatsapp and Slack). From now on, they will be conducted only on Slack, barring any emergencies. The screenshots to said chats could be seen on the Miro Board.

* **Sprint Review:** Since the team member responsible for AI study and C# scripting had to quit the Bootcamp towards the end of the first sprint and this development inevitably stalled the progress of our product, we've decided to work more hours in the coming two sprints to rectify our goals and catch up to our story points targets.
* **Sprint Retrospective:**
    - The Daily Scrums need more discipline from every team member and efforts to remedy absences will be taken.
    - Due to one team member's withdrawal from the project, as a four-people group, we need to revise the story points dedicated to each sprint.

* **Sprint Review:** While we have improved on our work, we've decided that the last week of this Sprint was not as fruitful as we've hoped it to be. In the meeting of 21st of May, this issue was discussed and ways to rectify it in the coming Sprint were laid out by team members.

* **Sprint Retrospective:**
    -Since this Sprint has showed what little time we've left could be crucial to creating an MVP, we've decided it would be best to manage our workload in a way that would be the most effective in the first week of the Sprint #3. This isdue to the fact that all members of the team, being students will prove the last week of the Sprint #3 to be very difficult in terms of collaboration.

* **Sprint Review:** Due to the workload we are facing in the last sprint, we decided that it would be best to focus our efforts on an MVP for the Academy's review. However, we plan to continue to collaborate in the future to improve our skills through this project and on the tools of collaboration.

* **Sprint Retrospective:** As it was the case, and stated in the report of the Sprint #2, we've done our best to manage our workload in order to create an MVP. While we've had more ideas and a better imagination for our game, sadly mostly due to a teammate leaving our team at 5th week of the 6-week Bootcamp program, unfortunately without completing any of their assigned tasks we've struggled to create even the MVP that we would like to present to the experts of the Academy. However, we still value the remarkable lessons we've gathered from the Google's Game and Application Academy Bootcamp. And we are incredibly grateful for the value that this program has provided us with, through a first-time, hands on collaboration of an actual project from start to finish.
