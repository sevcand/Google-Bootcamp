## Sprint #1

* **Sprint Notes:** Story points and user stories have been explained product backlog entries. The details could be found in full entry mode.
*  **Possible Sprint Completion:** 70 Points
*  **Backlog Orgnization and Story Choices:** Product Backlog is organized to detail every feature that is predicted to be implemented to the product by the end of the 3rd Sprint. Stories were based on how the product could be made more appealing to the user with graphics, animation, asset quality and so on.
*  **Daily Scrum:** In this first sprint, Daily Scrums were conducted on 3 seperate channels(ClickUp Chat, Whatsapp and Slack). From now on, they will be conducted only on Slack, barring any emergencies. The screenshots to said chats could be seen on the Miro Board.

* **Sprint Review:** Since the team member responsible for AI study and C# scripting had to quit the Bootcamp process towards the end of the first sprint and this development inevitably stalled the progress of our product, we've decided to work more hours in the coming two sprints to rectify our goals and catch up to our story points target.
* **Sprint Retrospective:**
 - The Daily Scrums need more discipline from every team member and efforts remedy absences will be taken.
 - Due to one withdrawal from the team, as a four-person group, we need to revise the story points dedicated to each sprint.
